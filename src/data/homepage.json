Once an idea begins to take shape, fidelity and details are steadily increased and the focus is shifted from sketches to wireframes, user stories, and architecture maps. Prototypes are also used to test ideas with users and generate buy-in from stakeholders on the team."

From here, Engineering is brought in to first understand the intended behavior, and then to implement. After launch, user behavior and feedback is gathered, with necessary adjustments made as needed."
