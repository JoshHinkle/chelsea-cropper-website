        "I was raised in the Bay Area, spent a few years at UCLA getting my degree in Design | Media Arts, and now live in San Francisco with a cat that isn't that great and a dog who is. If I'm not working, I'm probably playing a video game, visiting a ghost town, or at the SF Library researching local history. I'm also very fond of film photography and spend much of my time roaming around, enjoying the company of my camera. You can view some of our time together <a href=\"http://www.photos.chelseacropper.com\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.",
